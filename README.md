Note: You likely don't need the following line, but I ended up installing my board upside down. The code below rotates display output 180°.
display.rotation = 180 # I installed my board upside down so rotated it 180°

a STEMMA-QT Cable, a USB-C cable, and a laser-cut housing (.ai file enclosed is an Adobe Illustrator that can be used with most laser cutters)
